\# 1.5-Month AI/ML Developer Roadmap



> \*\*Small progress every day adds up to big results!\*\*



Welcome to my AI/ML Developer Roadmap repository! This repo documents my 45-day journey from foundational Python programming to building AI models and working with modern deep learning tools.

\## 🚀 Roadmap Overview



\### Phase 1: Foundations (Days 1-10)

\- Python basics: syntax, data structures

\- NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib

\- Data loading and cleaning (CSV, JSON)

\- ML concepts: Supervised vs Unsupervised learning



\*\*Project:\*\*  

\- Titanic Survival Predictor using logistic regression  

\- Dataset: \[Kaggle Titanic Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic)



\### Phase 2: Core ML Models (Days 11-25)

\- Linear and Logistic Regression

\- K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), Decision Trees, Random Forests

\- Model evaluation metrics: Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-score

\- Cross-validation and hyperparameter tuning



\*\*Projects:\*\*  

\- House Price Prediction (Linear Regression)  

\- Spam Classifier (Naive Bayes)



\### Phase 3: Intermediate ML \& NLP (Days 26-35)

\- Unsupervised learning: K-Means clustering  

\- Dimensionality reduction: PCA  

\- Natural Language Processing: Tokenization, TF-IDF, Word Embeddings  

\- Sentiment analysis basics  



\*\*Projects:\*\*  

\- Movie Review Sentiment Analysis  

\- News Topic Clustering (K-Means)



\### Phase 4: Deep Learning \& Large Language Models (Days 36-45)

\- Neural network fundamentals  

\- TensorFlow and PyTorch basics  

\- Transformers architecture and APIs  

\- Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) concepts  



\*\*Projects:\*\*  

\- Text Summarizer using Pegasus API  

\- Q\&A Chatbot with BERT + RAG
